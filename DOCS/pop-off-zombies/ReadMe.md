# Pop-Off Zombies v.0.9.7

![Zombies](media/zombiesDocMain.png)

Thank you for purchasing Pop-Off Zombies, a collection of unique polygonal zombie characters with limb dismemberment, bisection, ragdoll physics, and animations.

## What's new in version v.0.9.7

- **Special Zombies:** Added two new variants: The heavy Crusher and the volatile Bloated zombie.
- **Optimization 1:** New mesh combination system reduces draw calls significantly while zombies are intact.
- **Optimization 2:** Character setup already pre-processed. (mesh processing no longer occurs on runtime)
- **Benchmark Demo:** Scene with shooting and grenades!
- **Bisection:** Zombies can now be sliced in half at the waist, creating two independent ragdolls.
- **More Animations:** Added 6 new animations to the library.


## What is included?

* *Special zombies (NEW!): Crusher and Bloated.*
* *Themed zombies: Chef, cop, construction worker, doctor, hooker, military, nun, teen boy, 
 teen girl, and waiter*
* *Generic or casual civilian types*

## Demo scenes overview

### Demo_ZBench.unity

A compact shooting range where you can spawn, shoot, and blow apart dozens of zombies.

**Features:**

- Gunfire, grenades, and impact effects
- Stress test for ragdoll and dismemberment.
- Spawn and clear buttons
- FPS counter
- Day/Night toggle
- Zombie counter

Uses ZBenchCharacter and ZBenchLevelScript to demonstrate integration of movement, hit reactions, spawning, and runtime performance testing.

### Demo_Minimal.unity

Minimal scene + script to achieve bullet hit, limb detachment, ragdoll, and cut-in-half features.

## Core Scripts and Classes

### PopRig.cs
![Zombie component](media/zombie-component.png)

The **PopRig** component is the core of the system. It manages the list of detachable limbs, the ragdoll state, and the new mesh optimization features.

**Key API Methods:**

* **`PopRig.Limbs[i].Detach()`**: Detaches a specific limb, spawning a copy with independent physics while the rest of the body continues animating.

* **`PopRig.EnableRagdoll()`**: Activates full ragdoll physics for the entire character.

* **`PopRig.CutInHalf()`**: **(New)** Splits the zombie into upper and lower halves. Both halves ragdoll independently.

* **`PopRig.SwitchToCombinedMesh()`**: **(New)** Switches the character rendering to a single combined mesh for better performance. The system automatically reverts to separated meshes when a limb is detached.

**Hit Zones**
The system now includes a static helper `HitZone PopRig.GetHitZone(Collider c)` to identify body parts easily using Raycasts or Colliders. The returned HitZone object retrives the zombie (PopRig) and limb intances like this, along with body area information (Legs, Arms, Head...)

### Limb.cs


This class represents a specific detachable body part. It handles the low-level logic of limb mesh parts, bones, and physics joints required when a part is detached.

* **`Limb.Detach()`**: Separates this specific limb.

* **`Limb.ApplyBodyImpulse(Vector3 point, Vector3 direction, float force)`**: Applies physics force to the limb. If the limb is detached, it pushes the loose part. If attached, it pushes the main body's ragdoll.

### Editor/ZombieSetupWizard.cs

Zombie Setup is accessed via the main menu **Tools/DA/Zombie Setup**. This is the artist tool to configure or modify a character for the dismembering system. It cooks the necessary data for the PopRig class. This is not needed for runtime play. All included character are already pre-configured.



## Starting Guide

From version 0.9.7, character are preprocessed and ready for play mode.

- To start, drag any of the character prefabs to the scene.
- From anywhere you do a Physics Cast, call static PopRig.GetHitZone() to retrive information linked to the given Collider: PopRig and Limbs instances, Body zone, etc.
- Use methods like Limb.Detach() to pop-off zombie parts, or play with PopRig.EnableRagdoll() and PopRig.CutInHalf().
- Code your own scripts that interact with the Zombie component to trigger limbs detachments or body ragdolls when you decide.

**NOTE:** There is no AI behaviour, health system, or pathfinding implemented, it is up to your gameplay mechanics and particular needs.

## Roadmap

- Add a new set of ~8 special zombies.
- More animations: Pain, stand up from ground, etc.
- Basic NPC AI examples.
