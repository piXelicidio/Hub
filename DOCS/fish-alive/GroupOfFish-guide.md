# GroupOfFish Guide

The GroupOfFish component helps managing multiple fish instances, spawning, and movement boundaries. Automatically creates and assigns targets for the fish to follow.

## Basic Setup

To get started, drop the GroupOfFish prefab into your scene. You can populate the group in two ways:


**Manual Placement:** Drag your fish prefabs into the hierarchy and make them children of the GroupOfFish GameObject.

**Runtime Spawning:** Use the `Multiply The Fish` list (detailed below) to instantiate multiple fish automatically.

## Understanding Movement Limits

The component uses two types of boundaries to control where fish swim:

**Soft Limits (Natural Wandering):**

The SoftLimitsSize defines the volume where the fish's targets are allowed to roam.


The system creates an internal target (an invisible GameObject) for each fish. These targets are constrained to the Soft Limits, but the fish themselves are not strictly bound to them.

The fish strictly follow targets, but the targets are what stay inside the box, the fish turn and swim smoothly at the edges rather than hitting a wall and sliding along it. This creates natural, fluid motion.

**Hard Limits (Strict Boundaries):**

Enable `UseHardLimits` when you need a physical barrier, such as an aquarium glass or a cage.

This forces a hard check on the fish's position. If a fish hits the `HardLimitsSize` boundary, it is immediately stop and/or slide, preventing it from escaping the these limits.

## Spawning Population (Multiply The Fish)

You can increase density without manually placing every fish using the `Multiply The Fish` list in the Inspector.

- Add a new item to the list.
- Assign a Fish prefab to the Fish slot.
- Set the Count to define how many instances of that fish to spawn.

**Schooling Option:**

- Unchecked: Fish behave independently with their own targets.
- Checked (School): All fish generated by this entry will share a single target. This forces them to swim together as a coordinated group (schooling behavior).

## Debugging & Visuals

- Enable Gizmos to visualize the targets, and soft and hard limits of the GroupOfFish component helping you adjust the boundaries to fit your environment.

## Advanced Settings

- **Avoidance Override**: If enabled, this forces avoidance logic on all fish in the group, overriding their individual prefab settings.

- **Interactions**: Enables the FishInteract component, allowing fish to react to objects on specific layers (e.g., food).
